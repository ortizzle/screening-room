/* Family Movie Night — fmn/ideas.js
   The Ideas tab: shelves, recommendations, shortlist, idea detail.

   These files load in a fixed order from index.html and share one global
   scope, exactly as the single inline script did. Order matters: boot.js
   runs the startup calls and must stay last. */

/* ---------- RENDER: ideas ----------
   Three sources, best-first: Claude ("For us", needs a key), TMDB
   discover (needs a key, gives real posters + synopses), and a curated
   built-in shelf so the tab is useful with no keys at all. Titles the
   family has already logged are filtered out. */
/* Curated shelf, tuned for a 9- and 12-year-old across genres.
   tags: kid = the everyday crowd-pleaser shelf, classic = older films
   that still land with this age group, talk = worth discussing after
   (this is where the tasteful PG-13/R titles live). */
